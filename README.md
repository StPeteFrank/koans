# JavaScript Koans

These koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! In most cases the solution is in the question itself. This is about practice and exposure. This should be practiced regularly.

## Running the koans

First, fork and clone the repository, if needed.

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

Start editing `koans.js`. You only need replace instances of `__` in each test case to make it pass. You shouldn't need to edit any other code.
